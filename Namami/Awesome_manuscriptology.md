# Awesome Sanskrit Manuscriptology

This repository is dedicated to the intersection of Sanskrit Manuscriptology and Computational Linguistics, focusing on the application of modern AI and OCR techniques to the study and preservation of Sanskrit manuscripts.

It is estimated that only about 1/10th of Sanskrit literature is exposed to the daylight. The vast knowledge hidden in the manuscript will take 100s of years to decipher. But if AI can be leveraged to get it into readable form, the period can be reduced dramatically. That's the attempt.

## Personal Perspective: Why Pursue Sanskrit Manuscriptology?

Sanskrit Manuscriptology is a field that offers unique opportunities and challenges:

- It's a much-needed area of study with significant potential for research and development.
- The work is monk-like, requiring dedication and a lifelong commitment to learning.
- There's a heavy scope and need for AI applications in this field.
- It can be an "ikigai" - a reason for being that combines passion, mission, profession, and vocation.
- It involves specific knowledge that's not widely available, making it a valuable niche.
- The field has international relevance, with opportunities for collaboration in countries like Germany and the US.
- There are ample chances to write research papers and books for both academic and general audiences.
- Projects like Namami are unearthing vast knowledge, providing opportunities to become an expert in the field.

## How to Get Started

1. Pursue a course or degree in Sanskrit Manuscriptology:
   - Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI)
   - Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU)
   - Online playlists and courses (see [Video Playlists and Lectures](#video-playlists-and-lectures))

2. Focus on various scripts:
   - Sanskrit
   - Modi
   - Sharada
   - Study the works of experts like Shrinand Bapat

3. Develop AI skills:
   - Learn libraries like spaCy, OpenCV, scikit-learn, and PyTorch
   - Focus on handwritten recognition models and custom OCR techniques (e.g., pytesseract)

4. Approach the field as real R&D:
   - Embrace the lack of pressure and view it as an "ikigai"
   - Develop specific knowledge in the intersection of AI and manuscriptology

5. Learn Sanskrit on the side:
   - Continuously improve your language skills while working on AI and manuscriptology projects

6. Consider coaching or teaching AI applications in this field

## Technical Approach

A typical workflow for manuscriptology using AI might include:

1. Image Processing:
   - Input: Manuscript image
   - Process: Edge detection
   - Output: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

2. Feature Recognition:
   - Input: Vector graphics
   - Process: AI-based feature recognition
   - Output: JSON data structure

3. Knowledge Extraction:
   - Input: JSON data
   - Process: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
   - Output: Structured information and insights from the manuscript

This approach combines computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques to extract and understand information from ancient manuscripts.
