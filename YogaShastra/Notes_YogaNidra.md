	How to do Yoga Nidra
		- Lie down straight on your back in Corpse Pose (Shavasana). Close your eyes and relax. Take a few deep breaths in and out. Remember to take slow and relaxed breaths.
		- Start by gently taking your attention to your right foot. Keep your attention there for a few seconds, while relaxing your foot. Then gently move your attention up to the right knee, right thigh and hip. Become aware of your whole right leg.
		- Gently, repeat this process for the left leg.
		- Take your attention to all parts of the body: genital area, stomach, navel region, chest.
		- Take your attention to the right shoulder, right arm, palms, and fingers. Repeat this on the left shoulder, left arm, throat, face, and finally the top of the head.
		- Take a deep breath in and observe the sensations in your body. Relax in this state for a few minutes.
		- Slowly becoming aware of your body and surroundings, turn to your right side and keep lying down for a few more minutes. Rolling over to the right side makes the breath flow through the left nostril which helps cool the body.
		- Taking your own time, you may then slowly sit up, and whenever you feel comfortable, slowly and gradually open your eyes.

	Yoga nidra (yogic sleep) is a state of consciousness between waking and sleeping. It is a state in which the body is completely relaxed, and the practitioner becomes systematically and increasingly aware of the inner world by following a set of verbal instructions. This state of consciousness is different from meditation in which concentration on a single focus is required. In yoga nidra the practitioner remains in a state of light withdrawal of the 5 senses with four of his or her senses internalised, that is, withdrawn, and only the hearing still connects to the instructions. It is a powerful technique of pratyahara, providing a systematic method for consciously moving into the deeper realms of personality, removing physical fatigue, emotional imbalances and mental tensions, thereby revitalizing and restructuring one’s entire life. This beginners’ yoga nidra is an introduction to the potentials of the technique as taught by Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati.

	Rotation of consciousness through the different parts of the body is not a practice of concentration, and it does not involve any physical movement, During the practice there are only three requirements to be fulfilled: (i) remain aware, (ii) listen to the voice, and (iii) move the mind very rapidly according to the instructions. When the instructor says 'right hand thumb', repeat it mentally, think of the right hand thumb and move on. It is not necessary to be able to visualize the different body parts. You have only to become accustomed to following the same sequence, mentally repeating the names of the different body parts in the same way that the child learns to repeat the letters of the alphabet. You don't have to remember what part comes next. The whole process takes place in the subconscious mind.

	In the practice of yoga Nidra, the mind gradually becomes one-pointed while we disengage the other senses. The practitioner only maintains awareness of the auditory channel to prevent the consciousness from becoming withdrawn, which would result in mere sleep.
In such a way, during yoga Nidra the senses disconnect, and we can experience the fifth stage of Patanjali yoga, known as pratyahara.
