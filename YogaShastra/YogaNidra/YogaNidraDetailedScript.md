## What is Yoga Nidra?

Yoga Nidra, also known as yogic sleep, is a relaxation technique that can be practiced at different levels depending on the tradition and our skills. It is a fascinating practice that can take us from deep states of introspection to lucid dreaming.

Swami Satyananda Saraswati described Yoga Nidra as:

> "A systematic method of inducing complete physical, mental, and emotional relaxation."

The term is composed of two Sanskrit words: **yoga** meaning ‘union’, and **nidra** translating as ‘sleep’. However, Yoga Nidra is very different from ordinary sleep. It is often referred to as **psychic sleep**, allowing us to access subconscious and unconscious layers of the mind.
