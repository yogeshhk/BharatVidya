%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The chapter discusses the mind, its thinking process, and how both interact.
    \item How thoughts influence the mind and how the mind gets distracted.
    \item Examples are provided to show how our thoughts drift and how we lose track of the original subject.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Types of Drifting Thoughts}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Drifting thoughts can be classified into:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Controllable drifts
        \item Uncontrollable drifts
        \item Unrecognized drifts
    \end{itemize}
    \item Controllable drifts: When we realize the mind has drifted and we bring it back to the original subject.
    \item Uncontrollable drifts: When we completely forget the original subject and cannot recall how we got there.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Drifting Thoughts: Examples}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Example of controllable drift: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item We start thinking about one subject, but our mind wanders. 
            \item Realizing the drift, we bring ourselves back to the original thought.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Example of uncontrollable drift: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The mind jumps from one thought to another, and eventually, we forget what we were originally thinking about.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Impact of Thoughts on Actions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Our thoughts are directly connected to our actions.
    \item Understanding the thinking process helps shape our life.
    \item If we don’t control our thoughts, we may end up in a difficult mental state.
    \item We are responsible for our thoughts, and in turn, our actions and life direction.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Mind and Thought Control}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If we cannot control our thoughts, it can lead to an uncontrolled mental state, or "mind drift."
    \item By understanding the nature of mind and thoughts, we can learn to control and redirect them.
    \item Meditation can help in recognizing the thought processes and bring the mind back to focus.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Meditation and Mind Control}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Meditation involves observing the drifting thoughts without attachment.
    \item It helps in understanding which part of the mind is active and dominant.
    \item Achieving a focused, clear state of mind is the goal of meditation.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Drift Order}
\begin{itemize}
\item Drifts happen in the section of mind that deals with pictures, day-dreams.
\item Typically the come in this order:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sexual
\item Anger
\item Ego
\item Greed
\item Jealousy
\item Arrogance
\item Ignorance
\item Courage
\item Doubt
\item Day dreaming
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Drift: Change in thoughts away from the main subject.
	\item Types:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Un-controllable: Unaware of it, can not recollect
			\item Controllable: Can detect and come back to the main subject.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Mind, if not trained, can not channelize drifts.
	\item This drift is not property of the whole mind but one section within it.
	\item So, learn to separate sections of mind and understand the functionality.
    \item Understanding mind and thought drifts is essential for self-awareness and personal growth.
    \item Thoughts lead to actions, and actions shape our lives.
    \item Meditation and mindfulness can help control the mind and direct it towards constructive actions.
    \item Mastery over thoughts leads to a harmonious and controlled life.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This chapter focuses on three main concepts in Zenyoga: Simple Consciousness, Self-Consciousness, and Cosmic Consciousness.
    \item Simple Consciousness: Present in all living beings, including animals and humans.
    \item Self-Consciousness: Exclusive to humans, which helps us observe and control our mind's state.
    \item Cosmic Consciousness: A higher state of awareness that transcends individual identity.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Simple Consciousness}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Simple consciousness is a state present in all living beings.
    \item It allows us to be aware of our surroundings and react accordingly.
    \item This awareness is crucial for survival and adaptation to the environment.
    \item Animals also experience simple consciousness but lack the ability to reflect on their mental states.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Self-Consciousness}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Self-consciousness is unique to humans, allowing us to reflect on and control our mental states.
    \item Humans can observe their mood swings and emotions throughout the day.
    \item This ability to reflect and evolve one's mind is a key aspect of human nature.
    \item Unlike animals, humans can identify their identity and separate it from the environment.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Challenges in Self-Consciousness}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item While humans have the potential for self-awareness, it is often difficult to concentrate and meditate.
    \item Our comfort zone and habits prevent us from evolving our minds effectively.
    \item The difficulty lies in sustaining concentration and overcoming habitual patterns.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Cosmic Consciousness}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cosmic consciousness is a higher state of awareness that transcends individual identity.
    \item It is a state where one feels a deep connection with the universe.
    \item Achieving this state requires overcoming the distractions of the mind and focusing on a higher subject.
    \item It is a state that few have achieved due to the complexity of human tendencies.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Story of Narada and Krishna}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Narada Muni asks Lord Krishna why humans remain trapped in the illusion of the physical world.
    \item Krishna explains that humans have the potential to achieve enlightenment but are distracted by the mind’s tendencies.
    \item Narada Muni forgets his mission to bring water for Krishna after being distracted by a woman at the river.
    \item The woman reveals herself to be Krishna, demonstrating how even enlightened beings can be distracted by worldly matters.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Exercise}
\begin{itemize}
\item Put aside 15-30 minutes in a day to watch the drifts and note them down.
\item Take one thought as the main subject.
\item Let the mind drift.
\item Classify and note the drift.
\item Never try to make your mind ``blank''.
\item Analyze over 3 months, the persistent patterns.
\item After 15 days of consistent practice, you will start recognizing which mental centers dominate your mind.
\item Over time, this awareness will help you overcome mental distractions and develop a deeper connection with the 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Summary}
Forms of Consciousness:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple: like animals, awareness of body. Needed for daily survival.
\item Self: Aware of mental states, sense of self, thoughts.
\item Cosmic: Higher state. Not achieved by logic, reasoning, etc but by stronger awareness.
\item No one has shown practical steps to go from Self to Cosmic consciousness.
\item Even if we get to know the steps, they are difficult to follow. Old patterns are hard to break away from.
\item The journey from simple consciousness to cosmic consciousness is challenging but achievable with dedication.
\item Regular practice, patience, and awareness are key to evolving the mind and reaching higher states of consciousness.
\item Zenyoga provides tools to understand and transcend the mind's limitations, leading to enlightenment.

{\Large Chapter 3: What is the Mind of Man}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Introduction to Mind and Brain}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mind vs. Brain:} Saher explains that the mind is not equivalent to the physical brain.
    \item The \textbf{mind} is an accumulation of thoughts, while the \textbf{brain} processes these thoughts through sensory inputs.
    \item The brain uses sensory inputs (five senses) to capture, process, and decode external impulses, leading to personal interpretations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Individual Interpretation and Perception}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each individual interprets external impulses differently based on personal background, environment, and previous experiences.
    \item \textbf{Unique Interpretations:} No two people perceive an event in the exact same way; similar to how people react differently to the same movie.
    \item The mind remains \textbf{invisible}, as it is a collection of thoughts, making self-observation challenging yet essential.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Self-Understanding and Observation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Self-Observation:} Observing and understanding one’s thoughts is necessary to understand one's mind.
    \item Modern individuals often lack the time or willingness to introspect, limiting their understanding of themselves and others.
    \item Saher emphasizes that \textbf{self-reflection} enables clarity in understanding both oneself and others.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Connection with Others’ Minds}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Saher describes three possibilities when minds interact:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Affinity:} Similar thoughts lead to friendship, love, or positive relationships.
        \item \textbf{Repulsion:} Differences in thought can lead to disagreement, negativity, and hostility.
        \item \textbf{Indifference:} Lack of emotional reaction, potentially leading to detachment or even depression.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Nature of Mind and Emotions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Saher likens the mind to a \textbf{fabric woven from various thoughts}, colored by emotions.
    \item \textbf{Emotions} act as dyes, influencing the overall tone of the mind.
    \item \textbf{Habits and Patterns:} Positive habits strengthen the mind, while emotional quality affects its openness, resilience, and overall character.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Mind as a Cloth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Thoughts are strands
\item Emotions are the colors
\item Repetition or habit strengthens and makes cloth durable.
\item Quality of thoughts correspond to smoothness or roughness of the cloth.
\item Grey matter, attitude, thought process: Shape of the cloth
\item Likes/Dislikes: fashion of the cloth.
\end{itemize}

Constant daily practice can change the properties of the cloth.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Influence of Thoughts on Personality}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Thoughts accumulate over time, shaping \textbf{personality} and \textbf{character}.
    \item \textbf{Intelligence and Reflection:} Using intelligence helps define character by understanding and refining thoughts.
    \item Individual perception shapes how external impulses are decoded, reinforcing unique mental patterns.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Importance of Self-Observation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Saher encourages \textbf{watching and understanding one's mental patterns}.
    \item Ancient sages could observe both their own and others' thoughts, achieving clarity and wisdom.
    \item Self-awareness helps to evolve one's mind and break free from repetitive thought patterns.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Patterns and Automatic Reactions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Most individuals are \textbf{reactive}, like a tape recorder, responding automatically to stimuli.
    \item External stimuli often govern behavior without conscious understanding.
    \item \textbf{Key to Self-Control:} Observation allows individuals to move from reaction to conscious response.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Chapter 3 Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Brain is a physical entity.
	\item Impulses come from various sensory organs, which perturb the nerves/areas in brain. These are called as `thoughts'.
	\item Collection of thoughts (or the software/platform, in IMHO) is called as `mind'.
	\item Reactions to other minds can be of types:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Affinity: love
			\item Repulsion: hate
			\item Indifference

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Key Concepts of Mind's Impulse Reception and Decoding}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The mind receives external impulses and decodes them rapidly.
        \item These impulses are registered in specific areas of the brain.
        \item Each person's interpretation and reaction to the same impulse varies.
        \item Influencing factors include: Culture, character, education, circumstances, surroundings, and health.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Influence of Personal Filters on Thoughts and Actions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Impulses registered in the mind start as \textbf{pure mental energy}.
        \item This energy, unaltered initially, becomes modified when interpreted.
        \item Personal characteristics and surroundings color this interpretation.
        \item Thoughts impact personality, mental health, and actions significantly.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Four States of Impulse Processing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Pure Mental Energy State}: Initial state, unaltered and unprocessed.
        \item \textbf{Thought-Free Symbolic State}: Registered but remains unexpressed in words or images.
        \item \textbf{Mental Imagery State}: Formulated into mental images or daydreaming states.
        \item \textbf{Expressed State in Actions}: Converted into physical actions and expressions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Understanding Intention vs. Action}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item True actions are judged by intentions, not merely outward expressions.
        \item Actions may not always convey underlying intentions.
        \item Importance of internal purity over external validation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Insights from Patanjali's Yogasutra}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Five states of mind affecting pleasure or pain.
        \item Practices like \textbf{Non-attachment} help control mental fluctuations.
        \item \textbf{Constant Effort} (तपस्) is essential to restrain negative modifications.
        \item \textbf{Purification} of mind leads to clarity and cosmic consciousness.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Path to Pure Mind and Cosmic Consciousness}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Remove filters to perceive the true nature of impulses.
        \item Modifications act as filters, limiting pure awareness.
        \item Pure awareness emerges when filters are removed.
        \item Expanding awareness leads towards cosmic consciousness.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Chapter 4 Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Incoming impulses are decoded in brain as Pure Mind Energy, which are divided into:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Held: thoughts suppressed
			\item Words: expressed as words or mental pictures, day dreaming.
			\item Actions: Something is done by them, movements.
		\end{itemize}
	\item As per Patanjali पतंजली , there are 5 states (`vrutti' वृत्ती ) of mind (`chitta' चित्त ):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Correct Knowledge
			\item Incorrect Knowledge
			\item Fancy
			\item Passivity (sleep)
			\item Memory
		\end{itemize}
	\item Mind can be controlled (``chitta vrutti nirodh:'' चित्त वृत्ती निरोध ) by efforts, detachment.
	\item Peace of mind can be brought by regulation of ``prana'' प्राण (breath).
	\item Mental purification and clarity are keys to true perception.
	\item Detaching from modifications allows pure awareness to arise.
	\item Regular practice leads to cosmic consciousness and expansive awareness.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sleep is essential, but managing energy efficiently can reduce the hours needed.
        \item Saher compares sleep to income: well-managed sleep conserves mental and physical energy.
        \item Overuse of energy in unnecessary activities leads to a need for more sleep.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Different Types of Sleep}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Saher categorizes sleep based on its timing and impact:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{12am - 4am:} Most beneficial, replenishing energy.
            \item \textbf{11pm - 5am:} Intense and beneficial, suitable for restful sleep.
            \item \textbf{9pm - 11pm \& 5am - 7am:} Neutral sleep, provides minimal energy.
            \item \textbf{7am - 12pm:} Wastes energy, leaves one feeling tired.
            \item \textbf{12pm - 4pm:} Can harm health by depleting vital energy.
            \item \textbf{4pm - 9pm:} Damaging, attracts negative energy and illnesses.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Benefits of Reducing Sleep Hours}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item By reducing sleep to around 6 hours, one can gain 2-3 extra productive hours daily.
        \item Extra time can be spent on creative pursuits, learning new skills, and meditation.
        \item Saher encourages less sleep to engage more in life's constructive activities.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Meditation and Energy Regulation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Meditation benefits those who regulate energy and daily activities effectively.
        \item Saher emphasizes moderation in food, recreation, and sleep as keys to happiness.
        \item Excess sleep or too little regulation can disrupt inner peace and hamper meditation.

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Understanding Mind Centers in Zen Yoga}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mind contains several centers that decode impulses and gather energy units.
        \item Decoding occurs at specific frequencies, affecting thought intensity and storage.
        \item Mind is divided into four sections; however, only one section is accessible for most.
        \item Full access requires evolving section 1 centers to a balanced state.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Frequency and Thought Decoding}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Thoughts decode at a frequency of 112 pulses per minute.
        \item Each pulse decodes 12 thoughts, leading to varied positive or negative intensities.
        \item Average mind decodes thoughts at a high rate, resulting in constant energy consumption.
