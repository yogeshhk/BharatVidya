\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Customization of Yoganidra for Specific Issues}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Personalized Sankalpa संकल्प  (Resolve):}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The \textbf{Sankalpa} is a positive, personal resolve set at the beginning and end of Yoganidra.
                \item By choosing a specific Sankalpa, practitioners can focus on particular goals, such as improving confidence, reducing stress, or achieving health-related outcomes.
                \item The Sankalpa is phrased in clear, affirmative language (e.g., "I am calm and focused").
				\item 2-3 sentences, a decision of the patient for cure, must be positive and singular (use "I" not "You") formation.
            \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Targeted Visualization Techniques:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Visualization sequences can be customized to address specific issues by guiding the mind through images and scenes aligned with the practitioner’s intentions.
				\item A new file/pattern which is going to get overwritten on the old one, a directive from the therapist to the patient (use "You"), although results are in future, say it in present, meaning you have already got results.
                \item For example:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Anxiety relief:} Visualizing calm environments like a peaceful beach or forest.
                        \item \textbf{Healing:} Imagining light filling and healing the body, directed at areas of discomfort or pain.
                        \item \textbf{Self-confidence:} Visualizing oneself successfully completing tasks or achieving goals.
                    \end{itemize}
                \item For deeper emotional concerns, the visualization can include imagery that encourages letting go of negative emotions, promoting emotional release in a safe and controlled manner.
