%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Customization of Yoganidra for Specific Issues}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Personalized Sankalpa संकल्प  (Resolve):}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The \textbf{Sankalpa} is a positive, personal resolve set at the beginning and end of Yoganidra.
                \item By choosing a specific Sankalpa, practitioners can focus on particular goals, such as improving confidence, reducing stress, or achieving health-related outcomes.
                \item The Sankalpa is phrased in clear, affirmative language (e.g., "I am calm and focused").
				\item 2-3 sentences, a decision of the patient for cure, must be positive and singular (use "I" not "You") formation.
            \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Targeted Visualization Techniques:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Visualization sequences can be customized to address specific issues by guiding the mind through images and scenes aligned with the practitioner’s intentions.
				\item A new file/pattern which is going to get overwritten on the old one, a directive from the therapist to the patient (use "You"), although results are in future, say it in present, meaning you have already got results.
                \item For example:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Anxiety relief:} Visualizing calm environments like a peaceful beach or forest.
                        \item \textbf{Healing:} Imagining light filling and healing the body, directed at areas of discomfort or pain.
                        \item \textbf{Self-confidence:} Visualizing oneself successfully completing tasks or achieving goals.
                    \end{itemize}
                \item For deeper emotional concerns, the visualization can include imagery that encourages letting go of negative emotions, promoting emotional release in a safe and controlled manner.					
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Guidelines for Practising Yoga Nidra}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Practise in a quiet, closed room with comfortable temperature, free of insects.
    \item Ensure privacy and avoid sudden interruptions; semi-darkness is ideal.
    \item Room should be well ventilated but not breezy; avoid direct fan drafts.
    \item In open spaces, cover head and body to avoid disturbances.
    \item Maintain physical distance in group settings; wear light, loose clothing.
    \item Cover the body with a thin blanket as body temperature drops during relaxation.
    \item Practise daily at the same time: early morning (4-6 AM) or evening before bed.
    \item Practise on an empty stomach: wait 3 hours after a heavy meal, 30 mins after light snacks.
    \item If hyperacidic, light refreshments like tea, juice, or biscuits are allowed.
    \item Avoid deep sleep during practice; take a cold shower if feeling drowsy.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Need for a Qualified Teacher in Yoga Nidra}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Yoga nidra is simple but best learned under an experienced teacher initially.
    \item Regular lessons with private practice using recordings reinforce learning.
    \item Deep relaxation aids in effortless absorption of instructions, bypassing intellectual barriers.
    \item Teachers tailor practices to individual needs, emphasizing relaxation or meditation as required.
    \item Teachers prevent unintended sleep during practice by timely reminders like "No sleeping please."
    \item If no teacher is available, use recordings of live classes or have someone read instructions.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Preliminary Asanas for Yoga Nidra}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Pain and tension obstruct Yoga Nidra practice.
        \item Asanas should ideally precede Yoga Nidra.
        \item \textbf{Beginner sequence}: Pawanmuktasana, Shavasana.
        \item \textbf{Advanced sequence}: Sarvangasana, Halasana, Matsyasana.
        \item Additional advanced asanas: Paschimottanasana, Bhujangasana, Shalabhasana, Sirshasana.
        \item Surya Namaskara (6-12 rounds) loosens joints and massages organs.
        \item Naukasana (3-5 rounds) promotes physical relaxation for Yoga Nidra.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Position for Yoga Nidra}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Yoga Nidra is practiced in Shavasana for optimal relaxation.
        \item Lie on the back on a blanket or thin mat on the floor.
        \item Spine should be straight, arms slightly away from the body.
        \item Hands relaxed, palms up, fingers slightly bent or placed on chest.
        \item Legs straight, 30-35 cm apart to avoid thigh contact.
        \item No pillow preferred; thin pillow or folded blanket can be used.
        \item Pillow should support neck and shoulders without causing tension.
        \item Lower back may be supported with a small pillow if needed.
        \item Yoga Nidra can also be practiced sitting or standing if necessary.
        \item Standing is recommended if prone to falling asleep quickly.
      \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{How the Practice is Given}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Instructions should be given at a pace that keeps the mind active but attentive.
        \item Speed varies based on the stage of practice and the student’s state of mind.
        \item Rotation of consciousness and images should be quick and jump from point to point.
        \item Yoga nidra is not concentration; avoid prolonged focus on one point.
        \item Visualization images should be clear and rapid (e.g., mango tree, rose, boat).
        \item Extended visualizations should lead to deeper concentration practices later.
        \item For children, use rapid, un-associated images (numbers, colors, nature scenes).
        \item Visualization ability checks perceptive capabilities; clarity improves receptivity.
        \item Vary the practice according to time and student capacity, not just speed.
        \item Practices are arranged in a graded series to suit different levels of students.
