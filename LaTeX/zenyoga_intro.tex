\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Life Challenges and Distractions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Everyday life often brings distractions.
    \item These distractions pull us away from our spiritual path.
    \item The key is to maintain focus and clarity.
    \item Being aware of mental states helps avoid getting lost in distractions.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Superficial Life vs Profound Experience}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Superficial life focuses on sensory experiences and distractions.
    \item A profound life connects us to the divine essence within.
    \item By focusing inward, we can transform everyday activities into meditative experiences.
    \item This shift in perception prevents life from becoming boring or overwhelming.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Role of Mistakes in Life}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mistakes are a natural part of life.
    \item The key is to take responsibility for them without blaming others or external circumstances.
    \item Embrace mistakes as learning opportunities for growth and spiritual development.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Self-Awareness and Personal Growth}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Personal growth starts with self-awareness.
    \item We must understand our own mind and thought process to evolve.
    \item External circumstances will not change until we change ourselves.
    \item Spiritual practice is about transforming the self, not the external world.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Connecting with the Divine Essence}
\begin{itemize}
    \item True progress happens when we connect with our divine essence.
    \item This internal connection shifts our perspective, making challenges easier to handle.
    \item External objects and people no longer define us once we understand our divine self.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Change in Perceptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item We believe in what we actually see and hear, but there can be more than that.
\item We can see only between 0.00008 to 0.00009(?) cm. Rest is there but we cant see.
\item Examples: Radio waves which are 20km wavelength, cosmic rays which are $10^{-10}$mm.
\item We can hear only between 30 to 20k per second.
\item Can we still say that we know everything?
\item We are very much Deaf and Blind.
\item By practice of Zenoga, range of perceptions can be increased.
\end{itemize}

    \item Para-mental Center - Represents the influence in mental state.
    \item Transcendental Center - Transforms the mind into higher states.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Section 2a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Intercepts flow from physical body, senses.
\item Adjusts/tones-down/accentuates and sends to thalamus to cortex for decision making.
\item Thus body can report bodily disorders to brain directly without consulting conscious mind.
\item This covers all unconscious/autonomous functions.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Section 2b}
Concentration, Meditation, Intuition.

 \begin{center}

Goal: Cross the big gap/divide (no-mans-land) and go to CCS and further. Then Section 3 and 4 are sort of automatic.
We can cross the gap by developing Section 1.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Centers}

\begin{itemize}
\item Section 1: Physical Mind/Brain is divided into
\begin{itemize}
\item Integrity (I)
\item Emotive (E)
\item Sensual (S)
\item Mobility (M)
\end{itemize}
\item Section 2: Intuition
\item Section 3: Para-mental
\item Section 4: Transcendental
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Section 1 Centers}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1. Integrity (I): through intellectual introspection. ``iih'' - will to know, thinking.
\item 2. Emotive (E): Evocative of emotions, feelings, ``rajas''.
\item 3. Sensual (S): Sensuo-vitality, reflexes, drive, longings, ``tamas''.
\item 4. Mobility (M): muscular, ``manas''.
\end{itemize}

For any action/Mobility (ie 4th stage) dominant between the first 3 dictates. General ratio is 2-4-8-2. Aim is to improve I so that it dominates E and S, so that it dictates the action ie M. 

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Goal}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find how you take decisions. Is it 'I', 'E' or 'S'.
\item Work on consciously so as to Let 'I' dominate 'E' and 'S'.

    \item There are two types of Vasanas: inherent and acquired.
    \item Vasanas accumulate over time and influence future births.
    \item During death, accumulated Vasanas form a subtle body for reincarnation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Vasanas dictate the cycle of birth and death.
    \item Accumulated Vasanas influence the future physical form.
    \item We are trapped in the cycle of birth until Vasanas are cleansed.
    \item To break this cycle, we must work on replacing negative Vasanas.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item What is the opposite of birth and life? What is the purpose of life?
    \item Can an ordinary person attain enlightenment, or is it only for masters?
    \item Is free will real, or is life predetermined?
    \item Are we finite beings, or do we carry divine fragments of the infinite within us?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Free Will and Life's Purpose}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Is life completely predetermined or do we have the power to shape our own path?
    \item Understanding free will is essential to spiritual growth.
    \item Realizing that we have control over our lifeâ€™s direction leads to spiritual evolution.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
