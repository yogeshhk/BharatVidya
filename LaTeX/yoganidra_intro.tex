		\item \textbf{Yoga Nidra (योगनिद्रा)} is a deep relaxation technique that:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Relieves stress.
				\item Improves sleep.
				\item Accesses the bliss state (Ananda आनन्द).
			\end{itemize}
	\item Composed of series of body, breath, imagination acts to guide into progressive states of relaxation (non-doing)
    \item \textbf{Inspired by the Bihar School of Yoga}, this script follows the inward journey through the Koshas.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Yoganidra} translates to "yogic sleep" and represents a state of deep relaxation.
        \item Often referred to as the "4th state" or \textbf{Turya} in Mandukya Upanishad.
        \item Unlike regular sleep, Yoganidra involves deep relaxation combined with heightened awareness.
        \item Practiced through guided meditations that induce states of restful alertness.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Yoganidra is on the borderline between wakefulness and sleep.
        \item It balances conscious and subconscious awareness, bridging the gap between these states.
        \item Practitioners bypass the usual conscious filtering, allowing direct access to the subconscious.

        \item \textbf{State of Consciousness:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Yoganidra:} Achieves a state of Turya – deep relaxation with heightened awareness; mind remains alert.
                \item \textbf{Self-Hypnosis:} Involves a trance-like state where the conscious mind becomes passive, with a focus on specific suggestions.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Process:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Yoganidra:} Uses guided meditation to systematically relax each body part while retaining self-awareness.
                \item \textbf{Self-Hypnosis:} Often uses repetitive suggestions or imagery to access the subconscious for specific goals.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Purpose:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Yoganidra:} Aims for overall relaxation, self-awareness, and mental clarity; spiritual alignment.
                \item \textbf{Self-Hypnosis:} Typically used for behavior modification or addressing specific habits.
            \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Awareness Levels:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Yoganidra:} Maintains a balance between conscious and subconscious, with an element of witnessing.
                \item \textbf{Self-Hypnosis:} Primarily engages the subconscious with reduced conscious interference.

        \item \textbf{Applications:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Yoganidra:} Stress reduction, relaxation, self-exploration, and spiritual growth.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Limitations of Yoganidra}
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item \textbf{Only for Psychological problems:} 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Its a mental, psychological process, so no physical problems are solved
				\item Can not cure diseases like diabetics but the mental trauma associated with it
			\end{itemize}
			
        \item \textbf{Requires Guidance:} 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Proper guidance from a skilled teacher or accurate recordings is essential for effective practice.
                \item Self-practice without understanding may lead to superficial relaxation without achieving deeper benefits.
            \end{itemize}
        
        % \item \textbf{Misinterpretation as Sleep:}
            % \begin{itemize}
                % \item Yoganidra is often misunderstood as a sleep replacement, but it doesn’t fulfill the same physiological requirements.
                % \item The goal is conscious relaxation, not unconscious sleep.
            % \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Effectiveness Depends on Regularity:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Practicing sporadically may yield limited benefits; consistency is needed for noticeable mental and emotional transformation.
                \item Results can take time, requiring patience and dedication.
            \end{itemize}
        
        \item \textbf{Not a Substitute for Therapy:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item While beneficial for stress and self-awareness, Yoganidra may not replace therapeutic interventions for serious psychological issues.
                \item It is best used as a complementary practice rather than a sole treatment for mental health concerns.
            \end{itemize}
        
        % \item \textbf{Physical and Mental Readiness:}
            % \begin{itemize}
                % \item May not be suitable for individuals who find it difficult to lie still or relax, or for those with acute physical discomfort.
                % \item Requires some degree of mental stability and readiness to confront subconscious material.
            % \end{itemize}
        
        % \item \textbf{Expectations vs. Reality:}
            % \begin{itemize}
                % \item High expectations for instant results can lead to disappointment; benefits tend to accumulate gradually.
                % \item Practitioners should approach it with an open and patient mindset for best outcomes.
