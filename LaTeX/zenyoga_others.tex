\begin{itemize}
\item Yaksh यक्ष   : ``What's the most delusion that humans have?''
\item Yudhishthiara युधिष्ठिर: ``People live life as if they are not going to die''.
\item Its inevitable. No one has control. 
\item Only sometimes externally.
\item But we have no control internally. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item None of the internal organs behave the way we want. 
\item Including brain!! although we believe we have control on that
\item Brain is just another organ, a hardware. And mind is the energy/software that runs on it.
\item Proof: After death, hardware remains, but the software/energy is shutdown, so cant function.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item We have no control internally. Many centers are producing impulses. Most of the organ functioning is autonomous
\item Thus we cannot control mind, but we have to bring them to rhythm, balance.
\item As per Pantanjali पतंजली , daily, out of 13k impulses 120 go to brain. Rest are used to keep system working. Out of 120 to brain, 12 are per second, Only one becomes a thought. This just one more theory. May ignore. Just a model.
% \item We are interpreting life our way and not how it is

\frametitle{Mind}
\begin{itemize}
\item As per Patanjali पतंजली , Breathing is one way to control the mind.
\item Breathing happens as per emotions, eg. anger.
\item Can controlling breathing control emotions? Patanjali says, Yes.
\item Mind (Software) is run by breath. When Breath stops, its called death.
\item Need Deep, Rhythmic and Belly breathing
\end{itemize}

Volume

\begin{itemize}
\item The breath is full from neck to naval, i.e. the upper, middle and lower abdomen are filled to normal capacity
\item The quantum of air inhaled and exhaled is what is usually normal to us neither too much nor too forceful, since normal 3SRB is not an exercise but a process of correct breathing. 
\item Note: Initially, to establish the rhythm your breath will be deeper. Once, the technique and volume is mastered, then the volume of the breath will be normal as you breath today.
\end{itemize}

\item 12 cycles a minute to start with then to 24 and 36.
