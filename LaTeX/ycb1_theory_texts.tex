\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{The Vedas and the Upanishads}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Vedas Sections}: 
          \begin{quote}
          The \textsa{वेद} (Vedas) are divided into two sections:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Karma Kanda} (Ritual portion)
            \item \textbf{Jnana Kanda} (Knowledge portion)
          \end{itemize}
          \end{quote}
        \item \textbf{Upanishads}: 
          \begin{quote}
          The Upanishads are contained in the knowledge portion of the Vedas. They describe the inner vision of reality through self-inquiry and expound upon three subjects:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{The Jiva} - (Embodied soul)
            \item \textbf{Jagat} - (The World)
            \item \textbf{Ishwara} - (God or the creator of the universe)
          \end{itemize}
          The climax of the enquiry is the experience of the essential identity of \textsa{आत्मन्} (Atman) within with \textsa{ब्रह्मन्} (Brahman).
          \end{quote}
        \item \textbf{Vedic Yoga}: 
          \begin{quote}
          The Vedas contain the oldest known yogic teachings called Vedic Yoga. Vedic Yogis (\textsa{ऋषि}) taught how to live in divine harmony and see the ultimate reality through intensive spiritual practice.
          \end{quote}
