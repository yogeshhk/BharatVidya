	\begin{itemize}
	\item Yoga Sadhna is An Endless Ocean	
	\item You cannot be a Yoga Teacher/Guru just after training or certification, practice it for years (12), experience the benefits, then only teach.
	\item Small Sized Yoga Classes is a Must
	\item Meditation instructions lack emphasis on posture.
	\item Still Your Body and Steady Mind
	\item Persist with spiritual practices Long Enough
	\item Guru emphasizes endless hours, and dedication for yoga.
	\item Without steadiness, meditation cannot happen e.g. curd sets when still
	\item Asana brings steadiness and Pranayama brings lightness, pratyahara brings witness-bhava

\begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Inner Silence}


		\begin{itemize}
		\item Part of Pratyahara (withdrawal of senses).
		\item Our attributes: We always seek to know, we wish to live forever and know what we dont know, even gossip is ok. We want to be happy.
		\item Level 1: learn to live with sensory pulls and pushes. Accept distractions. Going to retreat is running away from reality. We cannot change 'outside'. Be immune to it by being aware. Stand there in the problems. Be witness like a traffic police.
		\item Summary:
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Lesser thoughts
			\item Clarity in thought without confusion.
			\item Lack of prejudice and being open.
			\item Ability to stay calm even when triggered 
			\item Non judgmental and not jumping to conclusions even without listening and knowing about a subject.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
